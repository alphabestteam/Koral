1. A web application is a software program or service that users access through a web browser over the internet. It runs on a web server and allows users to perform various tasks, such as shopping, social networking, or productivity, without needing to install anything on their devices.


2. A web server is a hardware or software that stores and delivers web pages and other content to users' web browsers when they request it using HTTP and other protocols. It acts as a central hub for hosting websites and handling incoming requests from users, ensuring the right web pages or resources are sent to their browsers.


3. Some usages of web servers in the market : 
Apache HTTP Server. A free and open-source web server used for many operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
NGINX. Initially designed only for HTTP web serving, this open-source software now also serves as a reverse proxy, HTTP load balancer, and email proxy. NGINX is known for its speed and ability to handle multiple connections, making it suitable for high-traffic websites.
Some advantages of a web server:
* Accessibility: Web applications hosted on a web server are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling a global audience to use them.
* Scalability: Web servers can handle a large number of concurrent users and requests, making it easy to scale your web application as it grows.
* Load Balancing: Web servers can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring even resource utilisation and preventing overload.


4. java servlet is a java program that allows a way to generate dynamic web pages. They are used to handle the request obtained from the web server, process the request, produce the response, then send a response back to the web server.  Servlets work on the server-side and are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the web server.


5. Apache Tomcat is an open-source imp;ementation of the Java Servlet and more technologies. It provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can also run. It plays a crucial role in the execution of dynamic and interactive web applications, allowing developers to build and deploy web services that can handle user requests and deliver content to web browsers.
