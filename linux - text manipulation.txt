Replace command with the specific command you want to run, and error.log with the name of the file where you want to redirect the error output. This will save the error messages generated by the command into the specified file.


4. In Linux, everything is a file. Every file has an associated number called File Descriptor (FD). File descriptors are used to access and manage files, sockets, and other input/output operations. They serve as a way for processes to interact with files and other resources.


5. A file descriptor is a handle used by the operating system to access a file or other I/O mechanism. So when you open a file, the operating system creates an entry to represent that file and store the information about that opened file. So if there are 100 files opened in your OS then there will be 100 entries in the OS (somewhere in the kernel). These entries are represented by integers like (...100, 101, 102....). Those entry numbers are the file descriptor. So it is just an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file for the process. It is the same as a phone number you dial to get a specific person, except on Linux the number will give you a pointer to a file.


6. command < input.txt
The "command" will take its input from the "input.txt" file.
