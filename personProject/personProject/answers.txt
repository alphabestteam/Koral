1. 
the needed field is : 

    base_salary = models.IntegerField(null=False)

2. to achieve the new field, we need to make a new migration file, like i did in the migration file : 

0005_alter_person_id_number_parent.py

we made a function "change_field_type" that changes the field of base_salary to an int field
